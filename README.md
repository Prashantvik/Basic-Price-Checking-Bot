# Basic-Price-Checking-Bot
Repository named <h5>"Basic Price Checking Bot"</h5> sends you a alert mail if price of a particular product falls down below a certain amount.  
Using modules and libraries "requests" and BeautifulSoup for Web scraping and smtplib for sending mails. I have created a very basic python automated price checking bot, which basically checks the price of a specific product on Amazon (you can use any other website) and sends you a alert email if price of that product falls down a minimun amount.
This program contains the python script and jupyter file with the execution of this particular script to show you how it works.
