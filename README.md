# Basic-Price-Checking-Bot
Repository named "Basic Price Checking Bot" sends you a alert mail if price of a particular product fells down below a certain limit.  
Using modules like "requests" and libraries like BeautifulSoup for Web scraping and smtplib for sending mails. I have created a very basic python automated price checking bot, which basically checks the price of a speicific product and sends you a alert email if price of that product fells down a particular number.
This program contains the python script along side with the execution of this particular script to show you how it works.
